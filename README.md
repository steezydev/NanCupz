## Testing

This contract is thoroughly tested using `chai` testing library to ensure correct I/O and state management

## Getting started

00 Set environmental variable in .env (check .env.example for reference).

- `NETWORK_TESTNET_URL` and `NETWORK_MAINNET_URL` can be obtained by creating an Alchemy project and getting an API key as an HTTPS url
- `NETWORK_TESTNET_PRIVATE_KEY` and `NETWORK_MAINNET_PRIVATE_KEY` are private keys for your wallet on testnet and mainnet. The wallet is used to fund gas needed for contract deployment
- `BLOCK_EXPLORER_API_KEY` is an Etherscan API key needed to automatically upload source code of the contract and verify deployment on Etherscan

01 Install `Hardhat` environment and other dependencies

```bash
yarn install
```

02 Update contract arguments inside `lib/contractArguments.ts`

03 Update allowlist configuration inside `lib/allowlist.ts` if needed

04 Update whitelists in a JSON format in `lib/lists/<LIST_NAME>.json`

05 Run tests for the contract

```bash
yarn test
```

06 Build contract

```bash
yarn build
```

07 Deploy contract to testnet or mainnet (contract address will be logged in the console)

```bash
yarn deploy:testnet
#or
yarn deploy:mainnet
```

08 Verify contracts source code on Etherscan (etherscan api key must be set as an environmental variable)

```bash
yarn verify:testnet
#or
yarn verify:mainnet
```

09 The owner of the contract is the same wallet you used to deploy the contract
